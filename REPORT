describing my learning algorithm. 
This is where you will describe the details of your implementation, 
along with ideas for future work.

I have solved the Banana Navigation environment by building a Deep Q Network agent which is trained using 

#Q Network:
Feedforward network with 2 hidden layers. 

#DQN Agent:

This interacts with the agent using epsilon greedy policy and learns using Adam optimizer.

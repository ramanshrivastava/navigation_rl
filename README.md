# Navigation_RL_Agent
An RL agent that solves unity's navigation environment 

## Project Details:
The README describes the the project environment details (i.e., the state and action spaces, and when the environment is considered solved).
**Overview:** Goal is to train an agent to successfully navigate Unity's large square world environment.

**GOAL:** A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

**State:** The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. 

## Getting Started:
The README has instructions for installing dependencies or downloading needed files.


## Instructions:
The README describes how to run the code in the repository, to train the agent. For additional resources on creating READMEs or using Markdown, see here and here.

## TODO: you should describe the environment that you solved, along with how to install the requirements before running the code in your ![repository]()

describing my learning algorithm. 
This is where you will describe the details of your implementation, 
along with ideas for future work.

I have solved the Banana Navigation environment by building a Deep Q Network agent which is trained using 

#Q Network:
Feedforward network with 2 hidden layers. 

#DQN Agent:

This interacts with the agent using epsilon greedy policy and learns using Adam optimizer. 

#Trainining 

trained in episodes and there are steps in each episode. 

#Unity environment interaction 

rewards are obsered by taking action in the environment. 

##Solved:
Environment solved in 411 Episodes!

#Future work:
This task can be simplified by trying to learn directly from pixels so we will not have to use hand crafted features for state.
